# Hello There!

<div class="intro-copy" markdown="1">

I am a doctoral researcher at the [IAI](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php), [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php), under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Veit Hagenmeyer](https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/921_1213.php).

My current research focuses on developing a security event correlation algorithm and conducting risk assessments to improve situational awareness and, ultimately, support decision making in Industrial Control System (ICS).
